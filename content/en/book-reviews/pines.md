*Pines* is the first book in the *Wayward Pines* series written by Blake Crouch. The story follows Ethan, a Secret Service agent sent to the town of Wayward Pines to locate a missing colleague. As Ethan spends more time in the town, he begins to notice oddities. The deeper he digs, the more the town's secrets unravel, sending him—and you—on a crazy adventure that you won’t want to put down.

*Pines* is my second novel read by Blake Crouch. This past year, I read *Dark Matter*. I liked both books for similar things:

- The pacing was very fast. Pages melted into the next.  
- There were twists I was not expecting that also left me satisfied.  
- When I had to put the books down, I kept thinking about the next time I could pick them back up.

On the other hand there were things I think the book could improve on. 

- Character development was alright. This was mainly an action driven book.  
- The diversity of characters was lacking.  
- The twist, while good, wasn’t exactly what I was expecting. I’m curious where the next two books will go.

In conclusion, *Pines* is exactly what I was looking for from another Crouch novel. It is fast paced, mysterious, and had a satisfying twist that kept me engaged. I am looking forward to reading the 2nd book in the series.
